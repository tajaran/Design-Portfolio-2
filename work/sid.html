							<h4>Summary</h4>
							<h2>SID provides crisis intervention education for people who want to support others.</h2>
							<p>SID focuses on the touch points that occur after the initial crisis. Oftentimes, people who experience a crisis will likely experience it again. SID provides the tools and resources for those who want to provide long-time support.</p>
							<p>The challenge was to figure out how we can map the crisis intervention experience. What tools do users need? What resources? The project's outcome was an IA overhaul, a defined style guide, and a redesigned website.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>The Problem</h3>
							<p>After 2 years, the clients didn't think users were getting the information they needed. Their analytics demonstrated a discrepancy in the user journey. There was high traffic at the beginning and end points of the 5-module sequence. This could mean that users weren't going in the intended journey. Additionally, the clients had no measurement for success. They weren't sure what content was most important, nor did they have a gauge on how people navigated the site.</p>
							<p>Before we formed solutions, we wanted to learn how they got here. I reviewed their past research, and performed a heuristic evaluation. I identified potential usability issues, understood the workflow, and current information architecture.</p>

							<h4>Ideation</h4>
							<h2>We thought about how to map the crisis intervention experience.</h2>
							<p>Our goals were to (1) match user's expectations on the landing page, and (2) increase scannability. I utilized our insights to create a new user flow. The user flow addressed immediate crises, and the most important content (figure 11). As a result, I also revamped the site's information architecture as well (figure 12).</p>
							<p>Once we felt that our wireframes mappaed the new user flow, we created a prototype for testing. We wanted to (1) identify usability issues, (2) validate our new workflow, and (3) verify if users can differentiate between different patterns and components. While there were no crucial usability issues found, there were opportunities to improve content. We also validated our new user workflow, and new website components.</p>

							<h4>User Interface</h4>
							<h2>I stayed faithful to theme, and optimized scannability.</h2>
							<p>My UI guiding principles were to (1) build on existing components, (2) design new ones as needed, and to (3) increase scannability.</p>
							<p>First, I performed a design audit to explore thematic elements. During user testing, users expressed joy over our porcupine mascot. Pairing it with curvy shapes created a personable and warm experience. Even if the topic at hand was suicide.</p>
							<p>Additionally, I defined the type hierarchy to increase scannability. I increased contrasted with the existing typefaces.</p>

							<h4>Reflection</h4>
							<h2>I learned about being intentional, using more discovery time, and understanding the platforms.</h2>
							<p>First, I learned to craft questions based on our research goals. Doing this helps focus your facilitation, and helps you gather the data you actually need. For instance, asking irrelevant demographic questions increased the potential for survey fatigue. Cutting out those questions could have prevented participants from dropping our surveys.</p>
							<p>Second, I wish I implemented other methods of discovery. I learned the most when I collaborated with the client. I wish I hosted workshop sessions to think through solutions with them. We could have done an affinity diagram together as opposed to completing it in isolation.</p>
							<p>Third, I designed and developed the website through their Squarespace platform. Unfortunately, I didn't realize how limited Squarespace was. To ensure I could replicate my designs, I ended up coding everything. It worked out in the end, but it added more time in the development phase.</p>
							<p>In the future I would like to perform a card sort activity. I want to refine the content labels to ensure users can find the information they're looking for. Also, I would like to test if the website helps people learn crisis intervention skills.</p>
