							<h4>Summary</h4>
							<h2>Helping grow your investment while helping homeowners keep their homes.</h2>
							<p>When homeowners can't pay their monthly mortgage the value of their notes decrease. As a result, Crowd Capital purchases these notes at a low cost then renegotiates the monthly payments with the homeowner to an amount they can realistically pay. When the homeowner's mortgage is stabilized, Crowd Capital sells these notes at a higher value. The amount the homeowner couldn't pay is subsidized by people who crowdfund through the Crowd Capital platform.</p>
							<p>In a nutshell, it's a low risk investment that helps homeowners keep their homes. There's blockchain technology and machine learning in helping mitigate risk, but you're better off learning more at <a href="https://crowdcapital.io">Crowd Capital</a>.</p>
							<p>Since Crowd Capital was still in it's infancy as a startup, the purpose of having a website was to get the word out there about their platform and encourage potential angel investors to invest in the concept. Our challenge was to design a website that articulated Crowd Capital's platform and captured the social impact message of their brand so that people can sign up for the newsletter.</p>
							<p>Lastly, I want to call out that this was my first project as a Designer. I'll talk about more about what I learned in my <a href="#reflection">reflection</a>.</p>

							<h4>On-Boarding Exploration</h4>
							<h2>When I was brought on board, they asked if I had any feedback for their initial UI mockup.</h2>
							<p>Using the mockup as a way to identify where they were in their design, I learned that there was an opportunity to embed a human-centered design process to the project. This meant my team was open to taking a few steps back in fidelity and think more about the problem we were trying to solve.</p>

					<!-- Assumptions -->
					<div class="content-child">
						<div class="content">
							<h3>Assumptions</h3>
							<p>User research was not part of the scope of our project (more on this in my Reflection), so we framed the problem on assumptions my team knew about our users: (1) They were socially conscious users who were investing for the first time; mostly likely had investments managed by family offices, and (2) They were unfamiliar with finance jargon, and would need extra support in deciphering it.</p>
							<p>Additionally, the Founder had done a significant amount of research on our competitors. My contribution was looking through their research to identify how we can emphasize our value proposition in our copy and visual brand.</p>
							<p>Based on what we knew from our research and assumptions, there were two questions we wanted to explore further: (1) how do we articulate our complex platform to people unfamiliar with how investing works and (2) how do we articulate that our value proposition is unique within the competitive landscape of crowdfunding and investment platforms?</p>
					<!-- Site Flow & Information Architecture -->
							<h3 id="h3-p">Site Flow&nbsp;&#38;&nbsp;Information Architecture</h3>
							<p>So how do we convey our story and explain our platform at the same time? My intention for this site flow was to use our landing page as a pathway to either learn more about our product or our company. The goal was to use as little content as possible on the landing page so that we didn't overwhelm the user with too much information (see figure 06).</p>
							<p>With our site flow in mind, that informed what our information architecture would look like. Since this was more like a marketing project than a product one, we focused on the static website first since the platform wasn't built yet. Creating this site map was helpful in helping my team visualize how dense our website would look like at a high level (see figure 07).</p>

							<p>Once we were happy with the site's structure, my low-fidelity wireframes served as a way to help my team visualize how much copy we were writing. My team revised the copy as I iterated my designs. Ultimately, we tested these designs to see how users would start their journey and to verify if they knew how to register for an account. In all 3 tasks we had an 80% success rate with 10 participants.</p>

							<h4>Reflection</h4>
							<h2>I wish I established a more user-centered process.</h2>
							<p>While I'm proud of all the work we've done, there were a lot of growing pains. I'll go over how I could have included user research and design documentation as part of the process, and the significance of cross-collaboration.</p>
							<!-- User Research -->
							<h3 id="h3-p">User Research</h3>
							<p>First of all, our baseline started with assumptions that the user didn't know anything about the crowdfunding space. Assumptions are okay, but if they go untested then we're just designing for ourselves. Doing research earlier could have informed us on what were the barriers for entry. Is it cost? Is it not understanding our platform? Knowing this could mean our landing page focuses on explaining our product or cost. While I validated that users knew how to sign-up for a newsletter, I didn't explore if we could compel them to do it.</p>
							<p>Additionally, having research helps support my design rationale. Looking back, it was difficult to support my designs because we were critiqing it on assumptions and personal taste.</p>
							<!-- Design Documentation -->
							<h3 id="h3-p">Design Documentation</h3>
							<p>As we progressed, doing some type of design documentation helped me frame my intent and goals for the designs. It provided some much needed focus. I saved a lot more time when I had some type of framework going into my iterations.</p>

							<!-- Cross-Collaboration -->
							<h3>Cross-Collaboration</h3>
							<p>This one is no one's fault. Our distributed team experienced challenges that prevented us from being cross-collaborative. We did our best with the resources we had at the time. With that said, having some type of cross-collaboration would have been wonderful. Working alongside the Visual Designer on their design decisions for the brand guide would have given me further insight on the design decisions that went into the brand guide. If I had talked to the development team sooner then we could have deployed a site that was closer to my wireframes. I could have considered other options I didn't think of because I don't have that perspective as an Engineer.</p>
