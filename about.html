							<h3 id="bottom-margin-2">Before I became a Designer, I helped facilitate social service and mental health programs for low-income families, foster youth, and people who wanted to die by suicide. </h3>
							<p>When I worked directly with people, I learned that I was most effective when I took time to understand their needs. I found that oftentimes people kind of already know what the solutions are, my role was to help fill those gaps and probe further on what makes them frustrated.</p>
							<p>When I managed programs, I learned how to collaborate with different stakeholders within my team and at other agencies. What became clear was that everyone saw the same problem through a different lens, and it's easier to get funding (and solve problems) when you take time to gather data and learn about a problem first before you get into solutioning.</p>
							<p>To me, becoming a Designer meant combining what I enjoyed the most from my career so far: learning what makes people tick, collaborating with others, and seeing your solutions make an impact in people's lives.</p>
							<p>Since changing careers I've graduated with my Masters of Science in Human-Computer Interaction at DePaul University, had stints in both consultancy and product teams, and became involved in civic tech through the now defunct Code for America Brigade system.</p>
							<p>When I'm not designing, I walk my dog, spend a lot of money at the Alamo Drafthouse with my wife, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqB7otvJF045GLSc0i9reFg">co-host/edit a podcast</a>.</p>
