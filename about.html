							<h3 id="bottom-margin-2">Before I became a Designer, I helped facilitate social service and mental health programs for low-income families, foster youth, and people who wanted to die by suicide. </h3>
							<p>As a Case Manager, I learned that I was most effective when I took time to understand my client's needs. I found that oftentimes people kind of already know what the solutions are, my role was to help fill those gaps and probe further on what makes them frustrated.</p>
							<p>As a Manager, I learned how to collaborate with different stakeholders within my team and at other agencies. What became clear was that everyone saw the same problem through a different lens, and it's easier to get funding (and solve problems) when you take time to gather data and learn about a problem first before you get into solutioning.</p>
							<p>To me, becoming a Designer meant combining what I enjoyed the most from my career so far: learning what makes people tick, collaborating with others, and seeing your solutions make an impact in people's lives.</p>
							<p>Since changing careers I've graduated with my MS in HCI at DePaul University, done a couple internship and contract stints, and became involved in civic tech through Code for America.</p>
							<p>When I'm not designing (and when it's not a pandemic), I do a little comedy. My training background is in clown/physical theater, improv, and storytelling. I've performed awful comedic bits at places like Second City (LA&nbsp;&#38;&nbsp;Chicago), iO West (RIP), and the Annoyance.</p>
